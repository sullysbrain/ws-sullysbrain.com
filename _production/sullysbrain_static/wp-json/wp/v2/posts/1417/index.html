But in reality, we are working alongside robots already, in the computer, as apps. What does this have to to with us as creatives?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As artists and creatives, we all know the struggles of working in a studio. The long hours, the tight deadlines, and the constant pressure to produce great work can take a toll on our creativity and motivation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But have you ever thought about how much easier your work would be if you had a coworker who could help you with all the tedious tasks? Well, that day may be closer than you think. The rise of artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the way we work, and it&#8217;s no different for artists and creatives. Whether you like it or not, machines are about to become your coworkers, and in this blog post, we&#8217;ll explore the threats and benefits of working alongside artificial intelligence in the studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Job Loss<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest fear for many artists and creatives is that artificial intelligence will replace them in their jobs. With the ability to produce stunning works of art, music, and even writing, machines are becoming more capable of doing tasks that were once reserved for humans. This could result in job loss for many artists, especially those who work in low-skilled positions. While some argue that machines can never fully replace human creativity and passion, there is no denying that they are rapidly closing the gap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lack of Personal Connection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another concern is the lack of personal connection that comes with working alongside artificial intelligence. As artists, we thrive on the emotional and personal connections we make with our work and our clients. With machines as our coworkers, there is a risk that we will lose that connection, making our work feel less personal and meaningful. Furthermore, machines may also be less sensitive to the creative process, resulting in a lack of feedback and support for our work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it\u2019s not all bad. In fact, there are many benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Increased Productivity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious benefit of having machines as our coworkers is the increase in productivity. With the ability to work 24\/7, machines can help us get more work done in less time. They can automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, image editing, and even writing, freeing up our time to focus on more creative tasks. This can help us meet tight deadlines and produce better work in less time, making us more efficient and productive in the studio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improved Creativity<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit of working alongside artificial intelligence is the potential for improved creativity. By taking over the tedious tasks, machines can help us free up our minds and focus on the more creative aspects of our work. This can help us be more imaginative and innovative, leading to better and more original works of art. Furthermore, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence can also help us discover new creative techniques and approaches, inspiring us to push the boundaries of our work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, I don\u2019t see AI as inherently bad or good. In fact, I see it as a mechanism to do things more efficiently. And that means good and bad things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I honestly think it will amplify human nature. People will use it to do what they do, but faster and bigger. (For better or worse). Example: AI can find case law in seconds for lawyers, instead of them searching for weeks doing research. Example: AI can track you downtown with face tracking and drone tracking. And believe it or not, the first draft of this article was written by AI after I fed it some parameters. I then went through and fine tuned it, expanding some thoughts, and editing out others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As artists and creatives, we are on the brink of a new era in the way we work. The rise of artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the way we produce and consume art, and it&#8217;s important that we embrace this change with open minds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are certainly threats to our jobs and our personal connections, there are also many benefits to working alongside machines in the studio. From increased productivity to improved creativity, there is no denying that artificial intelligence has the potential to transform the way we work. So, I ask you to take this as an opportunity to embrace the future and welcome our new coworkers with open arms.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The thought of machines as our coworkers brings to mind futuristic images of robots sitting in the cubical next to us and standing next to us on the bus going to work.
