# SullysBrain.com Design
Living document of my devops development process for my website, SullysBrain. 

### Progress
I begain by exporting a rough static version of my current design. First steps will be to clean up the directory structure, setup a cleaner -/css -/img -/js (etc) folders, and fix any broken elements in the CSS.

- Step 1: Create cleaned template for index.html


### Todo
- Django web backend, accessing SQL database. 
- Cache to static build
- Have dynamic REST ability to show real time SQL queries. 
- Build site within Docker environments (one for database, one for main app)
- Setup Jenkins for git -> production pipeline
